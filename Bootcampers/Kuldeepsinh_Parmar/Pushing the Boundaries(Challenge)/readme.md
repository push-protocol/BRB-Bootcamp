Thank you push team to organise such Bootcamp and accepting my application to allow me join the bootcamt.
It was very exieting journey, I got to learn so many things and come back to web3.
I almost gave up, this bootcamp brough my interest back into web3 with the beginner friendly intial sessions.
I was thinking about this idea for last 1 year but could not execute it, all credit goes to push team , and this bootcamp that I able to execute the idea and came up so far. I promise I'll complete this project and apply for grants.

Again thank you so much. I really appreciate your efforts and work behind this bootcamp.
