1. The Lockup period and Reward Amount should be immutable, as their values are constant even after the contract is deployed. 
   Currently, they are not set as immutable.

2. In the User struct, the stack id is initialized with uint8, which should be uint256 to avoid limiting the number of stakes. 
   The same issue is present in the code with { mapping(address => uint8) public userStakeCount; }.

3. The constructor constructor(IERC20 _token) incorrectly uses Ownable(msg.sender), 
   as there is no need for Ownable to take any parameters in the constructor.

4. The logic 
   if (rewardPool >= REWARD_AMOUNT) { 
    user.stakeAmount += REWARD_AMOUNT; 
    rewardPool -= REWARD_AMOUNT;  
   } 
   needs clarification. Rewards are added to the stake amount only if the reward pool is sufficient, 
   which might cause confusion and potential fund manipulation.

5. In the initializeUser function, setting userStakeData[msg.sender][0] to a zero User struct is redundant.
